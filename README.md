# Advent of Code

## I started doing Avent of Code Retroactively in 2020 and now would like to continue it. I have not taken it as seriously as I would have liked; however the code is here for me to go back and work on it at a later date.

## This repository currently contains my code for 2020 as well as for 2021.

## Note: All of the days will not be complete as there are some problems that I am unable to complete during that year.
